        <p>Dear Sofia Ma'am,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a moment on your special day to wish you a very happy birthday.</p>
<p>I will always be grateful for the time you spent teaching me the basics of coding, 
specifically in C++ and OOPs concepts. Your guidance helped me develop a strong
 foundation. But more than that, I will always remember your kind nature and willingness to help
. Your support and guidance have been invaluable to me, and I am so grateful for everything you have done for me.
 You have been not only a great teacher but also a friend and a second mother to me.</p>

<p>Once again, happy birthday and thank you for all that you do.</p>
